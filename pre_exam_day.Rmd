```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

I'm **uncreative** so this is my *first* VC project in RStudio.
Let's create a test stuff haha~

## Summary
```{r cars}
library(knitr)
kable(summary(cars))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r test-plot}
plot(cars, col = 'powderblue', 
     xlab = 'speed (mph)', ylab = 'distance (miles)')
```
